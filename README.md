# Furniture Reformers


An App that helps with your furniture needs and wants.

## Furniture Reformers: What is it?

We use generative AI to help users obtain, dispose, and refurnish furniture based on their needs.

## Why Furntiure Reformers? 

Our inspiration for "Furniture Reformers" stemmed from a confluence of factors. On a personal level, the environmental impact of improper furniture disposal troubles us. We envisioned
a solution that diverted the furniture from landfills and promoted a more sustainable approach to furniture usage. Furthermore, within our community we recognized a clear need for
resources. People struggled to find affordable furniture options or lacked guidance on responsibe disposal. "Furniture Reformers" emerged as a way to bridge this gap and empower users 
by connecting them with the resources they needed. Finally, the project ignited our entrepreneruial spirit. Allowing us to explore the potential of generative AI in tackling real-world 
problems. By integrating generative AI into the website, we created a platform that could not only connect users with information, but also utilize AI's capabilities to provide personalized
recommendations and solutions.

Our app lets users:
- Pick the type of furniture they would like to either buy or get for free based on location.
- Choose the type of furniture they want to dispose, donate, or sell depending on the size and location.
- Determine their furniture condition and material needed in order to refurnish it.
